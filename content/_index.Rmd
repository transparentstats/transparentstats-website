# Transparent Statistics in Humanâ€“Computer Interaction

Transparent statistics is a philosophy of statistical reporting whose purpose is scientific advancement rather than persuasion. We are interested in moving the field of <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> and related fields like visualization towards clearer and more reliable ways of writing about experiments.

We organize events at the [ACM CHI](chi) and [IEEE VIS](vis) conferences related to research transparency.

To learn about transparent statistics, check out the **[Transparent Statistics Guidelines](https://transparentstats.github.io/guidelines/)**
