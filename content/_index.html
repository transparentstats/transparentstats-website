<h1>Transparent Statistics in Human–Computer Interaction</h1>
<p>Transparent statistics is a philosophy of statistical reporting whose purpose is scientific advancement rather than persuasion. We are interested in moving the field of <abbr title="Human-Computer Interaction">HCI</abbr> and related fields like visualization towards clearer and more reliable ways of writing about experiments.</p>
<p>We organize events at the <a href="chi">ACM CHI</a> and <a href="vis">IEEE VIS</a> conferences related to research transparency.</p>
<p>To learn more about transparent statistics, check out the <strong><a href="https://transparentstats.github.io/guidelines/">Transparent Statistics Guidelines</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>Join us!</strong> The best way to get involved is to <strong>join our Slack</strong>—email <a href="mailto:core@transparentstatistics.org" class="email">core@transparentstatistics.org</a> and we’ll send you an invite. We also have a <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/transparent-stats-hci">mailing list</a> you can sign up for, but the Slack is more active.</p>
